                <p class="subtitle">
                    Developing web software, building software engineering skills, and designing graphics along the way.
                    <!-- As an open minded person, I like to explore a variety of experiences and am always eager to gain an
                    understanding of new concepts. -->
                </p>
                <p class="subtitle">I want to create a positive impact on everyday lives through my work.</p>
                <p id="subtitle-high">Three attributes: open-minded, contemplative, adventurous</p>

                <!-- <h2>Experience</h2>
                <h3>Coding skills:</h3>
                <p>
                    - Worked with Java, Dr.Racket, HTML, and CSS. Currently learning JS, and continueing to work on HTML
                    and CSS skills. <br>
                    - As a beginner, I am still working on building tech experience. I have participated in a few
                    hackathons too; an overview can be found in <a href="projects.html">projects</a>.
                </p>
                <h3>Work experience:</h3>
                <p>
                    - Worked as a piano teacher for a year where I learned a lot about communicating professionally and
                    being accountable. <br>
                    - Hoping to break into the tech industry soon, potentially through internships or the co-op program
                    at UBC.<br>
                </p> -->

                <!-- <h2>Interests</h2> -->
                <h3>Software Development</h3>
                <p>
                    I enjoy software development for the problem-solving aspect, and potential for impact. My primary skills are in front-end development, though I wish to explore full-stack technology too. I am always open to learning new technologies, and seeing how technology can be applied to problems.
                </p>
                <h3>Design</h3>
                <p>
                    Creativity is integral to how I operate, and the reason I enjoy designing graphics through various mediums. Having a background in business makes me keen to see things from a product and business perspective so I also enjoy product design and business consulting. 
                </p>
                <h3>Environmentalism</h3>
                <p>
                    I want others to be able to appreciate the beauty of the Earth. I think others want the same, but it can be hard to take positive action when there is a lack of direct incentive. I aspire to help close the intention-action gap so humans and Earth can flourish for years to come. 
                </p>
                <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                <p>
                    Outside of tech and business, I enjoy being outdoors and exploring new places. The adventure of delving into a different world really enriches my appreciation for the small details of life.
                </p>
                <h3>Future Goals</h3>
                <p>
                    Currently looking for a software engineering internship. While in University, I want to experiment with different roles (software engieering, product, design) and company sizes to find the right fit. <br><br>

                    "Memento mori" is latin for "remember death". Remember that time is a limited resource and should be cherished by pursuing events that are meaningful to oneself. I choose to grow through experiences without regrets.
                </p>
