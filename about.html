                <h1>About</h1>
                <p class="subtitle">
                    As an open minded person, I like to explore a variety of experiences and am always eager to gain an
                    understanding of new concepts.
                </p>

                <h2>Experience</h2>
                <h3>Coding skills:</h3>
                <p>
                    - Worked with Java, Dr.Racket, HTML, and CSS. Currently learning JS, and continueing to work on HTML
                    and CSS skills. <br>
                    - As a beginner, I am still working on building tech experience. I have participated in a few
                    hackathons too; an overview can be found in <a href="projects.html">projects</a>.
                </p>
                <h3>Work experience:</h3>
                <p>
                    - Worked as a piano teacher for a year where I learned a lot about communicating professionally and
                    being accountable. <br>
                    - Hoping to break into the tech industry soon, potentially through internships or the co-op program
                    at UBC.<br>
                </p>

                <h2>Interests</h2>
                <h3>Full Stack and Front End Development</h3>
                <p>
                    My main draw towards full stack development lies in its comprehensiveness. Personally, I tend to
                    strive towards a notion of independence so I like the idea that full stack can be utilized by
                    developers to create an application from start to finish. As for web development, I enjoy the
                    creative approaches to a user friendly experience that is forged through web design. As I become
                    more proficient as a developer in the future, I hope to be able to discover a stronger passion
                    towards these areas as I build expertise. Check out my <a href="endeavours.html">current endeavours</a> to see what I am
                    learning and working on at the moment.
                </p>
                <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                <p>
                    Outside of tech and business, I enjoy being outdoors and exploring new places whether that be
                    through hikes, bike rides, or simply walking. Travelling to different countries and areas is a very
                    valuable experience to me because the adventure of delving into a different world really enriches my
                    appreciation for small details that sometimes get overlooked, whether it be how the sky looks or how
                    people greet each other. Another hobby I just started picking up again is piano. I also started
                    boxing through the UBC boxing club which has been fun so far.
                </p>
                <h3>Future Goals</h3>
                <p>
                    In terms of future career aspirations, I hope to experiment a little with different career options while I am still in university. I would like to experience working at smaller companies and larger corporations, as well as working as a software engineer. In highschool, I was sold on the idea of being an intrepreneur ideally for a tech company, which is still something I might like to work up to. I am also interested in contributing to solutions for environmental concerns through technology and innovation as I predict those issue will only grow more prominent. <br><br>

                    Although it initally sounds a little grim, the phrase "memento mori" which is latin for "remember death" is a phrase that I like to remind myself of. It is signficant to me because it reminds me
                    that time is a limited resource and as such, should be cherished by pursuing events that are
                    meaningful to me. Regardless of my life's trajectory, I hope to grow through my experiences without
                    major regrets.
                </p>
