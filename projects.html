                <h3>Personal Website</h3>
                <p>This website. My first website that I designed, coded and finished from scratch!<br>

                <h3>Pill Tracker App</h3>
                <p> Java application that tracks weekly medication consumption with a console and graphical user interface. Started as a component of my CPSC210 (course on software construction) grade at UBC, I revised the application after the course ended to complete the features that I had envisioned for it. <br>

                <h2>Hackathon Projects</h2>
                <h3>ProduHacks - Pathw.EY</h3>
                <p>
                    As part of a product management hackaton, Pathw.EY was designed to be an EY internal mobile web application that utilizes metaverse technology to host an interactive VR platform for learning and development. The three main features were a gameified learning experience through virtual reality, a currated curriculum based on employee values and the currently instated learning program, and NFT badges. Given the problem statement, my team and I conducted analysis and considered user profiles, key performance indicators, and user acceptance testing. I learned a lot about product management practices through this experience.

                <h3>NWHacks 2022 - Appetime</h3>
                <p>
                    Ideated a fridge application that users can use to track the groceries in their refrigerator and their respective expiry dates. Main feature was a sustainability log that provided statistics on food wastage categories and trends that users could utilize to become more conscious of their waste habits while becoming smarter shoppers. I worked with my team to flesh out the idea and primarily contributed to the figma prototype design and video pitch. The code was created as a python console application. This was my first hackathon which was a fun experience that introduced me to the world of hackathons and projects.
